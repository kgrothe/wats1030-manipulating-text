Editors

If I had to choose an editor today to learn and always work with, I would choose Emacs. It seems very robust and versatile. There are many resoures available and there seems to be a large community of users sharing what they know. However, if I had a project due next week, I would use Nano. It is straightforward and easy for a beginner to use. The visible menu at the bottom was helpful. Vi seems similar to Emacs in robustness and options for customization. I preferred the Emacs tutorial and resources just a bit more which I why I'm choosing Emacs as my "favorite". Both Vi and Emacs were advertised as having a steep learning curve - I agree with this. Either would take time and practice to learn.

I tried to use the Search/Replace commands in Vi and Emacs. They both have ways to search for very specific combinations of information with wildcards. I wasn't able to successfully use these commands 100%, but I can see how using "regexp" would be handy and save time when working with large files.
